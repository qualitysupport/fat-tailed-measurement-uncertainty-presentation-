This measurement system analysis test uses data directly pulled from a calibration report of a flow sensor to model uncertainty. The goal is to visually demonstrate the use of Student T Distribution to help improve probability calculations. 
In this case, the false reject with the flow sensor would lead to excessive alarms and alerts in a computer system. Costs would incur from excess investigations from maintenance and quality departments. 
The core point of the test is to model the differences in tail distributions. 
The input data was taken from a calibration report at an ISO 17025 laboratory. 
5 test points were used to establish linearity. The residuals were calculated and a standard uncertainty and expanded uncertainty were calculated. From there the expanded uncertainty was set to a 95% confidence factor. 
Both data sets were modeled at 95% with one being modeled with 4 degrees of freedom representing the fat tailed risk adjusted distribution, while the second data set was modeled at 30 degrees of freedom representing a normal distribution. 
An application was developed to model different tolerances and output probabilities of false rejects. 
A perfect operation process with no process variation would underestimate risk if the fat tail risk wasn’t quantified. 
False Reject Risk (4 df): 0.776%
False Reject Risk (30 df): .003%
This relationship is non linear and scales differently depending on how the tolerances are set. 
Linearity was used as the only source of uncertainty due to logistical and economical factors. In most real-world cases, a calibration record would be a primary source of data in this case. 
The purpose of this test was to demonstrate how Student T Distributions can help improve probability calculations in risk determinations.
